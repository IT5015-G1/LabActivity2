Me Before You (2016)
Review 1:
In this romantic drama, based on a best-seller by a female author that has been devoured by hordes of female readers, a filthy-rich 30-ish man who has shut down his emotions forms a relationship with a fetchingly unsophisticated, younger woman of modest means who is willing to tend to his needs. What starts off as strictly a business proposition eventually grows into a more personal and cozier connection.
Review 2:
Louisa Clark is a "warm, chatty, life-enhancing presence with a lot of potential." That's how the 26-year-old's former employer, a café owner who is closing his business, describes her in a letter of recommendation after he's forced to let her go. But despite the gaggle of glowing adjectives in that sentence, if anything, it still undersells just how exuberant, effervescent and extroverted Louisa really is.
