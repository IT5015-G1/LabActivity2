A Wrinkle in Time (2018)

Review 1:
The best way to enjoy A Wrinkle in Time is to get past the Hollywood royalty and super-powered special effects. Focus instead on Meg and her story, and look forward to more adventures for girls in Hollywood's future.

Review 2:
Judged on its own terms, A Wrinkle in Time is a pretty good, perhaps even a quite good, movie. But it is a children's movie. See it with a child or--as DuVernay recommends--with a child's wonder. Otherwise, probably don't bother seeing it at all.
