Love Rosie (2014)
Review 1:
"Love, Rosie" is one of those annoying movies in which everything would be just fine if the two central characters had a simple conversation that cleared up all their misunderstandings. But then, there would be no movie although, in retrospect, that might not be such a bad thing.
Review 2:
This marzipan-sweet adaptation of Cecelia Ahern's 2004 bestseller, "Where Rainbows End," is elevated by vibrant visuals and the winsome chemistry of Lily Collins and Sam Claflin
