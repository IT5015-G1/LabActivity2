A Walk in the Clouds (1995)
Review 1:
A Walk in the Clouds is a glorious romantic fantasy, aflame with passion and bittersweet longing. One needs perhaps to have a little of these qualities in one's soul to respond fully to the film, which to a jaundiced eye might look like overworked melodrama, but that to me sang with innocence and trust.
Review 2:
"A Walk in the Clouds" is visually spectacular.
Review 3:
Pretty as a picture, but emptyheaded as hell.
