Wonder Woman (2017)
Review 1:
It's thrilling that Wonder Woman is enjoying the critical and commercial success that it is. But, in some ways it's also unfair. There is more weight than one film by one director about one woman should bear.
Review 2:
"Wonder Woman" is a superhero movie, and it fulfills the heroic and mythic demands of that genre, but it's also an entry in the genre of wisdom literature that shares hard-won insights and long-pondered paradoxes of the past with a sincere intimacy.
