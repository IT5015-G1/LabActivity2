Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)
Review 1:
I did find this to be one of the more inventive, aggressively offensive and insanely tasteless comedies in many a year. And yeah, that's a thumbs-up.
Review 2:
For better or for worse, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is unique, an important movie, a multiplex comedy that doubles as a conceptual art epic.
