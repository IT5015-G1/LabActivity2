White Chicks (2004)
Review 1:
White Chicks is a 2004 American comedy film directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, who wrote and produced alongside his brothers Shawn and Marlon Wayans. Distributed by Revolution Studios and Columbia Pictures, Shawn and Marlon Wayans portray two African American male FBI agents who disguise themselves as two white women.
Review 2:
Appealing performers and a couple of funny moments don't make up for a lazy and generic script in this predictable farce. This movie borrows characters and plots from many other movies.
