The Notebook (2004)
Review 1:
The Notebook cuts between the same couple at two seasons in their lives. We see them in the urgency of young romance, and then we see them as old people, she disappearing into the shadows of Alzheimer's, he steadfast in his love. It is his custom every day to read to her from a notebook that tells the story of how they met and fell in love and faced obstacles to their happiness. Sometimes, he says, if only for a few minutes, the clouds part and she is able to remember who he is and who the story is about.
Review 2:
A poor country boy and a rich city girl share an extraordinary love that spans the decades, enduring separation, war and disease. Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks.
