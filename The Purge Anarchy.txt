"The Purge: Anarchy is basically a slasher movie in which society is the deranged killer. It plays like it's already a grindhouse classic - dark, dirty, and disreputable." - Bilge Ebiri

Review 2:
"An equally effective, deliciously disturbing movie." - Tirdad Derakhshani

Review 3:
"Movies like this don't need to be smart, they just need to be entertaining, and The Purge: Anarchy is, if nothing else, entertaining." - Sarah Marrs
