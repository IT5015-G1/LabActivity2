Review 1:
"Split may not be to everyone's taste, but the story, craftsmanship, and excellent performances will haunt you for quite a while. As will some beastly bits." - Alexandra MacAaron

Review 2:
"Split isn't a disaster; it's just all over the place and not nearly as effective as it should be for something with such a good premise and performances." - Lindsey Bahr

Review 3:
"A solid thriller right up until the end, when the director decides to play to his fans and his own indulgences, rather than tying things up for viewers in a more satisfying way." - James Plath
