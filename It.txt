Review 1:
"What we're left with is a solid but relatively conventional horror movie, above average but overlong." - Christopher Orr

Review 2:
"The movie is not terrifying but blandly edifying; its scares, foreshadowed as if by telegram, are delivered less effectively than its life lessons." - Richard Brody

Review 3:
"Doesn't cut very deep and isn't very scary." - Stephanie Zacharek
