Zootopia (2016)
Review 1:
Zootopia, like its heroine, is zesty, bright, and breakneck, with chase scenes and well-tuned gags where you half expect songs to be.
Review 2:
There's a lot here for kids to like and nearly as much to keep parents from fidgeting.
Review 3:
In many ways a conventional movie, but it unfolds with so much wit, panache, and visual ingenuity that it outstrips many a more high-concept film.
Review 4:
What saves this big-budget cartoon behemoth is its modest, old-fashioned storytelling.
Review 5:
It's surprisingly sophisticated, finding new ways to get us to look past stereotypes.
