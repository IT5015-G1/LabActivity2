Review 1:
"By focusing the storyline on a particular form of racism -- the kind that's often disguised as peculiar envy -- Get Out reveals something more insidious." - Mary Elizabeth Williams

Review 2:
"What makes Get Out more than just a slam-bang scarefest is that, in its own darkly satiric way, it is also a movie about racial paranoia that captures the zeitgeist in ways that many more "prestigious" movies don't." - Peter Rainer

Review 3:
"Racism doesn't always have to be virulent, it can sometimes take benevolent and malicious forms as displayed in this haunting and topical film." - Wesley Lovell
