Logan (2017)
Review 1:
Another expensive throwaway aimed at milking money out of people who still read comic books. Color it stupid.
Review 2:
Strips away the spandex, the posse and the chaos, distilling the story down to the essence of the man, Logan. What's left is the agony and the ecstasy of mutanthood.
Review 3:
Jackman and Stewart are why Logan works-why the film doesn't feel like a cheap exercise in bloody violence, and its subversion of typical superhero-movie tropes feels organic.
Review 4:
Make no mistake, Logan earns its tears. If Jackman and Stewart are serious about this being their mutual X-Men swan song, they could not have crafted a more heartfelt valedictory.
Review 5:
The Wolverine movie I've wanted since I was eight years old.
