Metropolis (1927)
Review 1:
A fully realized work of art whose influence on science fiction, set design and symbolism can scarcely be put into words.
Review 2:
Lang's allegory of allegories posits humanity's progress as a collision not just of labor and management but of technology and sorcery
Review 3:
Metropolis remains the benchmark of agenda-driven extravaganzas, stirring and fun in the right spots.
Review 4:
The film is still something to behold, even if the newly restored footage occasionally looks like someone ran over it with a brillo pad.
Review 5:
Too bad that so much really artistic work was wasted on this manufactured story.
