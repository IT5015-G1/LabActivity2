King Kong (1993)
Review 1:
King Kong, as spectacular a bolt of celluloid as has thrilled audiences in a couple of sophisticated seasons, is the product of a number of vivid imaginations.
Review 2:
Willis O'Brien did the stop-action animation for this 1933 feature, which is richer in character than most of the human cast.
Review 3:
It's unrivaled in its sheer cinematic quality, and one of a kind.
Review 4:
Kong mystifies as well as it horrifies, and may open up a new medium for scaring babies via the screen.
Review 5:
The story, like Frankenstein and Dracula, has taken on the significance of a modern folk tale, layered with obvious moralizing and as familiar as personal history.
