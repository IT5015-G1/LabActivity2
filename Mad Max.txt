Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)
Review 1:
I'm not a fan of the Mad Max franchise, but "Fury Road" was excellent! "Mad Max: Fury Road" has a decent story (albeit with plot holes aplenty) and interesting characters with marvelous costume, makeup and special effects. It's truly spectacular.
Review 2:
This is one of the few movies I've ever seen where the whole audience broke into spontaneous, loud applause a third of the way in.
Review 3:
Mad Max: Fury Road delivers. There's no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Max roars back with a vengeance.
Review 4:
Believe all the hype: This movie will melt your face off.
Review 5:
I left the theatre trembling and with my hands sweating, and that's the best compliment one can give to a movie of this kind. Let the sequels come!
